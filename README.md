# ruby_workshop
I've created this repo to store my personal workshops. Right now I'm self-study and plan to keep uploading these as a means to keep track of my own progress over time. I'm currently a student of cyber security and hope to focus on Ruby / Python / Java / C#, as well as linux (Ubuntu, Kali + Kali Purple), and obviously networking stuffs since I'm studying cyber security. I'm going to make a repo for each language that I'm studying, as well as hopefully someday be able to create whole applications for others to collaborate with me on.
